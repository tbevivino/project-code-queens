                <h1 class="text-container">Parks</h1>
                <p class="text-container mt-sm"> When looking to move out of Manhattan, one of our main priorities was finding more space to run for our Siberian Husky/German Shephard, Meeko. We now have several parks within walking distance including: Socrates Sculpture park, Rainey Park and Astoria park. These parks not only provide an escape from the stress of the city, but have also become a source of community for us.  Through our daily trips to the park, we have been able to meet and connect with others in the neighborhood who are now close friends. </p>

                <h1 class="text-container">Restaurants</h1>
                <p class="text-container mt-sm"> The diverse restaurant options are something that I really enjoy about Astoria.  There is always somewhere new to try and we enjoy not having to travel into Manhattan to find great food. From the oldest Bier garden in NYC, Bohemian Hall, to the new coffee shop/pet cafe, Chateau le Woof, up the street from me, there is something for everyone and lots of options to explore.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="text-container mt-sm"> The location of Astoria provides great skyline views of Manhattan and some of the best sunsets. Living here for the past few years has ironically made me appreciate Manhattan more.  In the hustle and bustle of Manhattan, it can be hard to appreciate all that is surrounding you.  When I am at my apartment either on my balcony or on our rooftop, I am able to really take in the scale and the beauty of this great city that we live in.  </p>
